Welcome to _proverbdesk_, an interactive super blog by Greg Clark. ProverbDesk is designed to be a compendium of all my thoughts (I love to think, I love to write, I have cool stories I'd prefer to remember).

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` foler.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts.
